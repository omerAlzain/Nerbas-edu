This is the second slice(slice02) in a series of slices. the intention behind the slices is to provide a conceivable code to a newcomer.
While Slice01 concern has been about the web server and how it handel the http request through controllers, without touching the database.
This slice(slice02) started to dabble on the database, but it is not a real database; it has only one table, to give a newcomer what feels like being connected to a database.
