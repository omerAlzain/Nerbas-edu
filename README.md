This is the second slice(slice03) in a series of slices. the intention behind the slices is to provide a conceivable code to a newcomer.
While Slice01 concern has been about the web server and how it handel the http request through controllers, without touching the database.
And slice02 started to dabble on the database, but it wasn't a real database; it has only one table, to give a newcomer what feels like being connected to a database. 

This slice(slice03) added ORM and Module Functionalities. these features (ORM and Modularity) can't be added without the base and web modules which represent the Odoo's heart, so they had been added on this slice.
Although the base and web modules had been added, there is another small module (named slice03), had been set as default website.

Full oddo code can be found at [odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/).
